## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Gulp for Sass compile and browser sync
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Step back to good old time building UI with pure HTML and Sass and leverage gulp workflow.

It is a nice try to build a chat app UI with that.

### Continued development

There is still something need to update such as screen between 375px and 1440px, animation for chat app UI.


### Useful resources

- [Useful resource](https://sass-guidelin.es/) -This is an excellent website for advising on how to engage best practice with Sass
